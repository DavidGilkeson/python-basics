# Variables are containers for storing data values

# Python has no command for declaring a variable.
# A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.

x = 5 # This means x is a type of int
x = "String" # y is type of string

print(x)
# Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.

# Casting
#If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.

x = str(3) # x will be '3'
y = int(3) # y will be 3
z = float(3) # z will be 3.0

print(type(z))

# String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes:

x = "David"
# is the same as
y = 'David'

# Variable names are case sensitive

a = 4
# is not the same as
A = 5
